              I am a personal trainer certified through the American Council on Exercise, specializing in working
              with older adults. My clients range in age from 70 to 93 years old. Many of them had been recovering from
              surgery or illness or managing chronic diseases. Through strength training and stretching, they
              have improved their quality of life and now enjoy greater health and independence.

              After undergoing hip and knee replacement surgeries within a 10 month period, I found myself struggling with
              the same issues my clients face: loss of strength, balance, and endurance. While searching for
              resources, I came across the Urban Poling, Inc. website. Having already tried other walking poles, I
              was impressed by their unique Activator poles. I became certified as a UPI instructor and am
              passionate about Nordic Walking. I keep poles and hiking shoes in my car, ready to hike at any time!
