          I am a personal trainer certified through the American Council on Exercise spcializing in working with older adults.  My clients have ranged in age from 70 to 93 years old.  Many of these people were recovering from surgery or illness or managing chronic disease.Through strength training and stretching, they improved thequality of their lives and enjoy greater health and independenc.

          Following  hip replacement and knee replacement surgery in a 10 month period, I found myself struggling with the same issues my clients face: loss of strength, balance, and endurance.  I was casting about looking for resources and came across the Urban Poling, Inc. website. Having already tried other walking poles, I was in awe of this organization and their unique Activator poles. I took the leap and became certified as a UPI instructor. I am passionate about Nordic Walking and carry poles and hiking shoes in my car, ready to hike at any time!
